# MongoDB updateOne Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error when using MongoDB's `updateOne` method: silent failure when the document doesn't exist. The provided `bug.js` file showcases this issue, where `updateOne` is called without the `upsert` option.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code.

## Problem

The `updateOne` method, without `upsert: true`, will only update an existing document. If the document doesn't exist, it will return an empty result, misleading the developer into thinking the operation was successful.

## Solution

Adding the `upsert: true` option to `updateOne` ensures that if the document doesn't exist, a new document is created.

This repository serves as a quick example for developers to understand this subtle yet crucial aspect of MongoDB operations. Always consider using `upsert` when you intend to either update or insert a document based on a condition.
